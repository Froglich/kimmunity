# Kimmunity

A social media site with text and image sharing capabilities. All pages are in Swedish.

The demonstration version of this site runs on a Raspberry Pi, so I have tried to place as much processing as possible client-side.

## Potential improvements

* Clean up user search javascript.
* Add video intregration for more platforms than YouTube.
* Change web scraper for link metadata to use an HTML parser.
* Allow user to crop profile pictures in the browser.
* Rescale pictures in the browser when uploading photos.
* Nicer welcome and reset password e-mails.
* Error messages really need to be clearer.
